# The Filter Game

Welcome to The Filter Game. Want to know the magic of filters in mathematics? Play it!

# Online play

If you don't have Lean installed in your computer, don't worry!
You can [play online using Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/Biiiilly/filter) (wait a minute for set up). 
After everything is set up, open up the `src/game` directory on the left, and start with `level_00_basic.lean`.

# Installation

If you have [installed Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html),
that's perfect!

You can open the terminal and insert:

```
leanproject get Biiiilly/filter
```
Then, you can open the folder where it's installed and start the game!

# Instruction

There are seven levels in this game:

* Level 0       : This level contains basic contents of filters. There is no puzzle in this level.

* Level 1       : We introduce the filter basis and discuss relevant properties of it in this level.

* Level 2       : Given two filters (or filter basis) F and G, we talk about how to define F â‰¤ G in this level.

* Level 3       : This level discusses the principal filters and relevant properties.

* Level 4       : This level discusses the ultrafilters which is the minimal (maximal in the set order) proper filterand relevant properties.

* Level 5       : One of the applications of filters is about topology, and we will go through some of them in this level.

* Level 6       : This level contains some challenging puzzles.

It's recommended to start with level 0, then go to level 1...
