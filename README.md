# The Filter Game

Welcome to The Filter Game. Want to know the magic of filters in mathematics? Play it!

# Online play

If you don't have Lean installed in your computer, don't worry!
You can [play online using Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/Biiiilly/filter) (wait a minute for set up). 
After everything is set up, open up the `src` directory on the left, and start with `level_00_basic.lean`.

# Installation

If you have [installed Lean using the instructions at the leanprover-community website](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html),
that's perfect!

You can open the terminal and insert:

```
leanproject get ImperialCollegeLondon/complex-number-game
```
Then, you can open the folder where it's installed and start the game!
